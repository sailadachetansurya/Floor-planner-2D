# 2D Floor Planner - Java Swing GUI Application  

## Overview  
This is a simple 2D Floor Planner application built using Java and Swing GUI. It allows users to design floor layouts by placing rooms and furniture components with drag-and-drop functionality. The application supports grid snapping for precise alignment and includes custom file export/import features for saving and loading floor plans.  

## Features  
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Easily place and rearrange rooms and furniture.  
- **Grid Snap**: Components automatically align to a grid for precise positioning.  
- **Custom Export/Import**: Save and load floor plans in a unique file format.  
- **Raster Scanning**: Efficient implementation of grid snapping and collision detection.  
- **Swing GUI**: Intuitive and user-friendly interface for designing floor layouts.  

## How to Use  
1. **Launch the Application**: Run the main Java file to start the Floor Planner.  
2. **Design Your Floor Plan**:  
   - Select rooms or furniture from the available components.  
   - Drag and drop them onto the grid.  
   - Use grid snapping for accurate placement.  
3. **Save/Load Plans**:  
   - Export your design to a file for later use.  
   - Import previously saved plans to continue editing.  

## Requirements  
- Java Runtime Environment (JRE) 8 or later  
- A compatible operating system (Windows, macOS, Linux)  

## Installation  
1. Clone or download this repository.  
2. Compile and run the Java application using:  
   ```sh  
   javac Main.java  
   java Main  
   ```  

   ## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

## Future Improvements  
- Support for multi-floor designs.  
- Enhanced export options (e.g., PNG, SVG).  
- Additional furniture and room customization.
